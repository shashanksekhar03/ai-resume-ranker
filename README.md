This repository contains the source code for a project I created to automatically rank resumes based on a job description. First, the program extracts keywords from the job description, reducing text by 90+%. Next, it reduces the text in each resume by as much as possible. All of this information is sent to the OpenAI's gpt-4o API, which returns a JSON response ranking each candidate by relevancy to the position. The website is hosted on vercel. The site includes a drag and drop box for resumes and a slider-based rubric that the client can change to prioritize certain qualifications.
